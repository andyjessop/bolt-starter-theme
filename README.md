bolt-starter-theme
==================

A bare-bones theme for Bolt CMS, focussing on SEO-friendly and semantic code.

To install manually, go to `theme/` and do a checkout: 

  git clone https://github.com/andyjessop/bolt-starter-theme.git

Set `theme: starter` in your `app/config/config.yml`, and you're good to go!

There's a gulpfile included, to get set up, run:

    npm install

Then:

    gulp

This will compile your scss files and concatenate js files and place them in the correct folders.
